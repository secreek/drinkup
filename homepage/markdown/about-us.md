We are a small group of people who love both open source and beer. We are looking forward to bringing together geeks and nerds to share our passion in building something cool, and we'd like to be your host. Professional developers and students interesting in startups, software development, product design and geeky stuff are invited to participate in these events. Gear up for your next adventurous trip with hackathon and drinkup!
